excerpt: 'This paper is about improving the <i>coverage</i> and <i>efficiency</i> of [conformal prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07511) for deep neural networks, using novel non-conformity score computation methods. Specifically, the focus is on improving the robustness of medical image classification models (CNNs) via improved <i>uncertainty quantification</i> techniques.'
