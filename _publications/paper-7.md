title: "Towards trustworthy artificial intelligence in musculoskeletal medicine: A narrative review on uncertainty quantification"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /paper-7
excerpt: 'This paper could be considered the culmination of my studies on uncertainty quantification (UQ) and how it can be applied to biomedical ML problems. We introduce a very wide variety of UQ techniques (Bayesian, conformal prediction, evidential DL, test-time augmentation, etc) *and* propose a taxonomy that can help the reader better understand the overall landscape of these methods. We also showcase several studies that have successfully utilized these methods in musculoskeletal (MSK) medicine and focus on the translational potential of UQ, arguing for its necessity if DL models are to be utilized as reliable clinical tools. I was involved with all sections of the manuscript in this study and did a comprehensive literature review for this project; I also designed the graphical figures.'
