title: "U-ConvNext: A Robust Approach to Glioma Segmentation in Intraoperative Ultrasound"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /paper-8
excerpt: 'This study is the result of an almost yearlong effort on improving the SOTA on intraopreative ultrasound (iUS) segmentation. The end result is an improved U-net variant based on the ConvNext architecture leading to significant improvements in Dice score and Hausdorff 95th percentile distance, as well as a novel approach to uncertainty quantification (UQ) for semantic segmentation titled **conformal segmentation**. The choice to pursue this direction was motivated by the inherent uncertainty in iUS segmentation due to unclear borders and loss of fine detail in this modality.'
