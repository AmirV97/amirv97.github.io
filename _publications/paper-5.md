excerpt: 'This paper extensively analyzes prescription patterns for antihyperglycemic drugs in terms of factors such as physician specialist, time between follow-up sessions, comorbidities, etc., using large scale data directly from Iran Health Insurance (IHI) servers. I was the primary data analyst in this project, performing all steps of data retrieval, cleaning and processing. The analysis included techniques such as [GESD](https://statisticseasily.com/glossario/what-is-generalized-extreme-studentized-deviate-gesd-test/) and [SHAP value](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/overviews/An%20introduction%20to%20explainable%20AI%20with%20Shapley%20values.html) usage for intrepreting factors affecting overall prescription costs.'
